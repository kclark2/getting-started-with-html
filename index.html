<b>Making a paragraph</b>
<p>If you us the packman mouths around a 'p' then it starts paragraph body text. Yay!</p>
<b>Bolding stuff</b>
<p><b>Trying to write something in bold</b> 
I see you have to write the first <b>'b'packmans first</b>.
</p>
<b>Italicize</b>
<p>So I guess the packmans around <em>'em'</em> italicize <em>stuff</em>.</p>
<b>Linking stuff</b>
<p>Okay so the example text has '<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496">This video</a>
  does a good job of explaining' as an <em>example</em> of <b>bolding stuff</b>.</p>
  <p>First, you have to use 'packman a href=' to mark the beginning of a link. The text that you want to link goes 
    into inverted packmen, like <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496">this</a>.
  </p>
  <b>Also this</b>
  <p>Very important for <a href="https://vine.co/v/e7QhhjvvTUe">life</a>.</p>
